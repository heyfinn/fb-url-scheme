## A simple click to retrieve fb url
One click on plugin icon, and you will get a Facebook protocol-based url(shortened as "fb url"). Fb url can be useful in many application. I use this plugin to paste result fb url to Apple Contacts. Once I click the url in Contacts information, it will directly open Facebook app. Yeah lol.
