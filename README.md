# fb-url-scheme
## A simple click to retrieve fb url
One click on plugin icon, and you will get a Facebook protocol-based url(shortened as "fb url"). Auto-copy is conducted once you click the icon, so there's no need to copy again!

Fb url can be useful in many application. I use this plugin to paste result fb url to Apple Contacts. Once I click the url in Contacts information, it will directly open Facebook app. Yeah lol.

## Build
To install needed packages, type in terminal:

```
$ npm install
```
Build project, followed by:

```
$ gulp
```
> If you haven't installed global gulp, please conduct local gulp in `node_module`.


## Restriction
This plugin only supports Facebook profile and page detection.


Enjoy project in `build/`.
